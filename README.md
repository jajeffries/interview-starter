Checkout Kata
=============

We have a shopkeeper with a new checkout system. He scans in the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) of the items, hits total and the total price is displayed. Goods are priced individually, however there are weekly special offers for when multiple items are bought. For example "A99 are 50 each or 3 for 130". Weekly offers change frequently.

| SKU | Unit Price | Special Offer |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| A99 | 50		 | 3 for 130         |
| B15 | 30		 | 2 for 45          |
| C40 | 60     |                   |
| T34 | 99     |                   |

The checkout accepts the items in any order, so that if we scan B15, an A99 and another B15, we'll recognise two B15 and apply the discount of 2 for 45.
